# React Dad Jokes Application

App designed as practise using an external API, React Hooks and experimenting with using the fetched response in creative ways.

I decided to use the Axios library to peform AJAX requests because it is used extensively with React in real life applications (instead of just these pesky virtual apps!)

This app also gives me the opportunity to experiment with counters and events based on interaction with a component. In this cas eit is cotes for or against a given dad joke.

I will use Local Storage to persist data. I didn't see any reason to make this into a full stack app. It is, however, a great practice API (much like the Chuck Norris Joke API) and I encourage anyone who wants to learn web development, especially with a JS framework, to use eithe rof these APIs:

- Chuck Norris Joke API: https://api.chucknorris.io/
